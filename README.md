Hi, 
I hope you are doing well. 

For whomever it is reading this, on this repository you will find some of my cybersecurity practices,
which include but are not limited to, performing network audits and discover network insecurities of public companies, 
implement passive sniffing using Wireshark, tracing network communication and analyze network activity of local & 
external networks,  and generate custom network activity and demonstrating various network attacking techniques. 
I hope you enjoy it. 

Thank you, 
Diego Plata.
