1. A server port is a logical construct that represents a specific endpoint or communication channel in a computer network. It is identified by a numerical value known as a port number. Ports allow multiple services or applications to operate simultaneously on a single device, each having its unique port number to facilitate communication.

2. The server port range typically refers to the set of port numbers available for use in networking. In the context of TCP and UDP protocols, valid port numbers range from 0 to 65535. Ports below 1024 are well-known ports reserved for commonly used services, while those above 49151 are dynamic or private ports.

3. The port range of 0 to 65535 can be represented using 16 bits. This is because 2^16 equals 65536, providing enough unique combinations to cover all possible port numbers.

4. 10 most common server ports and their associated services:
     1. **Port 21** - FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
     2. **Port 22** - SSH (Secure Shell)
     3. **Port 25** - SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
     4. **Port 80** - HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
     5. **Port 110** - POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3)
     6. **Port 143** - IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)
     7. **Port 443** - HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
     8. **Port 3306** - MySQL Database Server
     9. **Port 3389** - Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
     10. **Port 8080** - Alternative HTTP Port (often used for web proxies)
