1) What do I see?

ANS: 

- It displays the current directory in which the php script is saved and the name of a file  on the same level of wk10 (it's trying to access one level above our origin directory)

2) What sensitive info is there?

ANS:

- The current directory wk10 given and the file name called index.html (something very dangerous due to it shows our working structure of our project)
